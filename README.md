# Warning

It's possible that this program could corrupt save files (if GD's save format changes and my regexes match on something else or there's an edge case that I never tested). Keep a backup of your save file before using (although you should always have one).

# How to use

## Step 1
Open an mp3 from your data folder in Audacity and add labels where you want to see guidelines ingame:

## Step 2
Hit Ctrl-A to select all tracks and export the labels as a text file:

Select the file Audacity generates when you run the app.
